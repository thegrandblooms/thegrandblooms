### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
---
My name is **Blake McMeekin** and I'm a Data Scientist. Before that I managed prototyping labs in small businesses for about ten years, doing 3D printing and laser fabrication to develop and test new products. I also started a company, [Alterity.Design](alterity.design), which procedurally generates consumer products like lamps and jewelry.

I became a Data Scientist after listening to lectures by researchers like JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber and Demis Hassabis, reading a textbook about the Science of Science, and watching the breakthroughs coming from OpenAi and Deepmind. It felt clear that Data Science will only become more important over the coming decades, and shortly after I graduated from Flatiron's Data Science program.

I am a deeply curious person at heart. I love to learn what reality is, how everything fits together, to use that understanding to make the world a better place, and to share that curiosity with others through teaching and learning. I work best in curious, highly-motivated environments with teams who believe in what they do and take pride in their work.

### What I'm up to:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on citation network analysis of academic or patent databases.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Graph Neural Networks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on data projects generally with a good mission and a good group of people.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help finding some entry-level Data Science work - any referrals deeply appreciated!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning, Complex Systems, or design...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I invented a microscope! Check it out [here](alterity.design/projection-microscope).
