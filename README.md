### Hello! 👋
---
My name is **Blake McMeekin** and I'm a Data Scientist and Product Designer. I've managed prototyping labs in small businesses for about ten years, setting up 3D printing and prototyping labs to develop and test new products. I also worked at a startup analytics agency called Source Medium. I started a company, [Alterity.Design](https://www.alterity.design/), which procedurally generates consumer products like lamps and jewelry.

### What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as an independent designer and taking a break from Data work!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about optical systems design & product distribution systems
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate on data projects generally, but especially those working with NLP or science of science.
- 🤔 I’m looking for side contracts and interesting open-source projects...
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Complex Systems, or design...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I invented a microscope! Check it out [here](https://www.alterity.design/projection-microscope).
