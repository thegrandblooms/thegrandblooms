### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
---
My name is **Blake McMeekin** and I'm a data scientist, product designer, and prototyping generalist. I studied Machine Learning and worked at an analytics agency called Source Medium that managed data for over 100 companies like Clif Bar, Dr. Bronners, Olipop, etc. I started and run a company, [Alterity.Design](https://www.alterity.design/), which procedurally generates consumer products like lamps and jewelry. Before all this I managed prototyping labs in small businesses for about ten years, setting up fabrication labs to develop and test new products.

### What I'm up to:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working as a freelance designer and engineer, and making jewelry commissions
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m mapping semantic dimensions and extracting meaning from text
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on data projects generally, but especially those working with complex systems sciences and semantic processing.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for side contracts and interesting open-source projects...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI, Complex Systems, or Design
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I invented a microscope! Check it out and make one [here](https://www.alterity.design/projection-microscope).
