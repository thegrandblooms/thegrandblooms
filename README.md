### Hello! 👋
---
My name is **Blake McMeekin** and I'm a Data Scientist and Product Designer. I studied Machine Learning and worked at a startup analytics agency called Source Medium. I started and run a company, [Alterity.Design](https://www.alterity.design/), which procedurally generates consumer products like lamps and jewelry. Before all this I managed prototyping labs in small businesses for about ten years, setting up fabrication labs to develop and test new products.

### What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’ve been working as an independent designer and engineer!
- 🌱 I’m mapping semantic dimensions and extracting meaning from text
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate on data projects generally, but especially those working with complex systems and language processing.
- 🤔 I’m looking for side contracts and interesting open-source projects...
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Complex Systems, or design...
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I invented a microscope! Check it out and make one [here](https://www.alterity.design/projection-microscope).
